# NoteO
Note-Taking Software that prioritizes productivity and automates organization

As someone who learns constantly and has ideas overflowing their brain, I have found modern note-taking softwares just aern't cutting it. Because of this, I decided to make my own. This will be done to aid my remaining two years of university. Designed and tailored to my math/physics notes, prioritizing features I love, and will hopefully help organize my learning. 

# Goals and features
---Terminal

A terminal based note-taking software that abandons fancy ui's. These ui's are developed for ease of acess and broad public use, but I find all of the features and plus signs to create a folder just inhibit my productivity. I love a simple terminal, with easy file, directory, and navigation like linux. While I could use linux to make my notes, I also want them to be in their own dedicated environment where I can quickly click on them or see them. Therefore, this project is a mix of both worlds. 

For this, I took the regular commands and changed them a bit for my use. These are, cd, touch, nano, rm, mkdir, and ls. I have changed these to open, create, edit, remove, folder, and list. Along with this, usually cd would move you backwards in the directory, but I have just included a simple back command. 

---Ideas first, organize later!

I do not like having to create files, folders, or labeling dates before I can start writing down thoughts or ideas. Therefore, I have created a send command which will transfer whatever I have written into the notepad to whatever file I choose. This means that the user writes down what he needs to, then he creates the folders and files he wants to place this writing in. It allows for a tree of ideas to sprout naturally, without having it planned beforehand. The date on top of the page automatically updates accordingly.

---Math Notation

I study physics in university, so I usually have to include math notation and greek letters into my notes. For this, softwares typically use the LaTex plug-in which lets you code some math notation into your notes. While I have used and tried this, I just want visual notes that I can use for future referance. Therefore, I decided to just use jpg's for each notation I find use for. They are toggled with / and will list below this accordingly. For example, /a will list /alpha, /a_hat, and so on. To take away this search function either press enter on the notation desired, or simply delete the /. 

---Omni-Directional Cursor

For the highest order of freedom, I have also implementad a cursor that can move freely with the arrow keys. Letters do not have to be present and there are no constraints for note-taking. The user can move the curser left, right, up, and down, as much they like without having to touch the mouse or trackpad. 

---Useful Shortcuts

(Ctrl+T) - This command will automatically send your cursor to the terminal so you can start typing commands

(Ctrl+N) - This command will automatically send your cursor to the notepad so you can start typing notes

(Ctrl+Arrow Keys) - The site is set up by multiple boxes that vary in size and use. This command helps toggle between them quickly and efficiently.
